# FIR_Filter_Design

* This is an individual project for EN2570 - Digital Signal Processing module in department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.
* Final goal of this project is to design and implement an FIR bandpass digital filter under given specifications.
* A bandpass filter attenuates all the frequencies except a band of frequencies which we are wanted to obtain in the output.
* Digital filters are used almost everywhere in telecommunication field.
* Although there are many methods to design digital filters with various accuracies, here we are only looking at the Fourier Series method with Kaiser window which is a direct method of filter designing.
* In this process, the infinite impulse response of the ideal filter is truncated with the Kaiser window in time domain.
* The filter is implemented using MATLAB R2018a and plots are used for analyzing purposes.
* Filter Visualization Tool (‘fvtool’) in MATLAB is very useful in plotting results.
* Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms have been used to analyze the filter output for the input excitation signal.
